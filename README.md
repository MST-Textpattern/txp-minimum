Minimum theme for Textpattern

A huge *Thank You* goes to [Amit Varia](http://amitvaria.com/), who inspired this theme.

Minimum does enable you to publish your writings, but it does not allow you to:

* use comments
* use categories, sections, or even tags
* use article images (technically you can use images inside articles, just no article image)
* include a contact form
* hook up to social networks or have sharing buttons
* show off a massive link collection

Minimum is a theme that lets you write. What else would you need?

PS: Since Minimum is so limited in what it does, changing most preference settings does not have much of an effect. It is, however, suggested that you have nice URLs (/article should be just fine) and disable the comments.
